            <h2>The Journey of Our Founder</h2>
            <p><strong>Joseph</strong>, the founder of Joseph Orphanage Home, began his journey in a small town in Uromi. Growing up with little but a heart full of love, he learned that the greatest gift he could give was hope. After completing his studies at Ilaro Polytechnic and working briefly in the construction industry, Joseph realized his true calling wasn't in building buildings, but in building lives.</p>
            <p>In 2017, with little more than a dream and the will to make a difference, Joseph founded Joseph Orphanage Home. His vision was simple: provide vulnerable children with a loving, nurturing home, where they could find safety, education, and the opportunity to dream. What started with just a few children has grown into a beacon of hope for many.</p>
